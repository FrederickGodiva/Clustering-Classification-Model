# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing ship performance data from the Gulf of Guinea using unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. Specifically, it encompasses:

- ***Clustering***: To identify distinct groups of ships based on their operational characteristics, revealing underlying patterns and similarities within the dataset.
- ***Classification***: To build predictive models that can categorize or predict specific attributes of ships based on their operational metrics.

The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of ship performance, identify key factors influencing operational efficiency, and provide insights that can be used for optimization and decision-making within the maritime domain.
